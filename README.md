## Schnell finden, Schnell filmen, Schnell wachsen

The first Open Source project for the collaboration of bloggers of different directions.

The principal objective of the project is to establish a platform that facilitates connections and the identification of individuals engaged in blogging activities. Our vision entails the development of an application that enables the search for author profiles on TikTok based on interests, popularity, and geographical location. A crucial aspect of this search is the incorporation of convenient filters. Additionally, we aim to create a straightforward, user-friendly, and expedient avenue for authors of varying degrees of popularity to establish profiles. This will entail the ability to access the platform and promptly view videos created by the author, which should streamline the process of locating specific individuals.

The project was made by students of Die Therese-MÃ¼nsterteicher-Gesamtschule
